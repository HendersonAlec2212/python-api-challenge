Some problems with Linear Regression:
• It works best to predict values when the relationship between variables is linear. If r is close
to zero, ˆy will not be a good predictor of y, in general.

• Extrapolation: The line is intended to predict values of y for values of x that are close to the
data. Using the line far outside that range may produce unrealistic forecasts.


The coefficient of determination, r2, is the proportion of the variation that explained by the
regression line


- After reviewing the graphs, it is easy to see the increase in temperature as on approaches the Equator (Latitude = 0).

- Few graphs produced correlations as strong as that of the Latitude vs. Temperature figures, however it was interesting to see how many cities have an "all or nothing" trend when it comes to cloudiness. Seeing data of so many cities plotted before oneself, it is something to consider that the town I live in is quite bland with average temperatures, wind speeds, and humidities when compared to some the outlying cities in this generated data frame.
